# Creating A Shapefile with ESRI ArcMap Instructions

This notebook contains instructions for how to create a shapefile. These instructions are intended for those who have access to ESRI ArcMap.
Note: this notebook is intended to be run after working through the companion georeferencing notebook. The final georeferenced GeoTIFF file cannot be uploaded to GitHub because it is too large. You can still practice creating a shapefile by selecting a different file, such as Major_Streets.shp (included in this repository) for the reference data.
